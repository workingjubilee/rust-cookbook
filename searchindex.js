cookbook is intended eventually to provide expansive coverage of the Rust crate ecosystem, but today is limited in scope while we get it bootstrapped and work on the presentation. Hopefully, starting from a small scope and slowly expanding will help the cookbook become a high-quality resource sooner, and allow it to maintain consistent quality levels as it grows. At present the cookbook is focused on the standard library, and on \"core\", or \"foundational\", crates—those crates that make up the most common programming tasks, and that the rest of the ecosystem builds off of. The cookbook is closely tied to the Rust Libz Blitz , a project to identify, and improve the quality of such crates, and so it largely defers crate selection to that project. Any crates that have already been evaluated as part of that process are in scope for the cookbook, as are crates that are pending evaluation.","breadcrumbs":"A note about crate representation","id":"about.html#a-note-about-crate-representation","title":"A note about crate representation"},"about.html#a-note-about-error-handling":{"body":"Error handling in Rust is robust when done correctly, but in today's Rust it requires a fair bit of boilerplate. Because of this one often sees Rust examples filled with unwrap calls instead of proper error handling. Since these recipes are intended to be reused as-is and encourage best practices, they set up error handling correctly when there are Result types involved. The basic pattern we use is to have a fn run() -> Result that acts like the \"real\" main function. We use the error-chain crate to make ? work within run . The structure generally looks like: #[macro_use]\nextern crate error_chain; use std::net::IpAddr;\nuse std::str; error_chain! { foreign_links { Utf8(std::str::Utf8Error); AddrParse(std::net::AddrParseError); }\n} fn run() -> Result<()> { let bytes = b\"2001:db8::1\"; // Bytes to string. let s = str::from_utf8(bytes)?; // String to IP address. let addr: IpAddr = s.parse()?; println!(\"{:?}\", addr); Ok(())\n} quick_main!(run); This is using the error_chain! macro to define a custom Error and Result type, along with automatic conversions from two standard library error types. The automatic conversions make the ? operator work. The quick_main! macro generates the actual main function and prints out the error if one occurred. For the sake of readability error handling boilerplate is hidden by default like below. In order to read full contents click on the \"expand\" () button located in the top right corner of the snippet. # #[macro_use]\n# extern crate error_chain;\nextern crate url; use url::{Url, Position};\n#\n# error_chain! {\n# foreign_links {\n# UrlParse(url::ParseError);\n# }\n# } fn run() -> Result<()> { let parsed = Url::parse(\"https://httpbin.org/cookies/set?k2=v2&k1=v1\")?; let cleaned: &str = &parsed[..Position::AfterPath]; println!(\"cleaned: {}\", cleaned); Ok(())\n}\n#\n# quick_main!(run); For more background on error handling in Rust, read this page of the Rust book and this blog post .","breadcrumbs":"A note about error handling","id":"about.html#a-note-about-error-handling","title":"A note about error handling"},"about.html#about-cookin-with-rust":{"body":"","breadcrumbs":"About \"Cookin' with Rust\"","id":"about.html#about-cookin-with-rust","title":"About \"Cookin' with Rust\""},"about.html#how-to-read-this-book":{"body":"The cookbook index contains the full list of recipes, organized into a number of sections: \"basics\", \"encoding\", \"concurrency\", etc. The sections themselves are more or less ordered in progression, with later sections being more advanced, and occasionally building on concepts from earlier sections. Within the index, each section contains a list of recipes. The recipes are simple statements of a task to accomplish, like \"generate random numbers in a range\"; and each recipe is tagged with badges indicating which crates they use, like rand-badge , and which categories on crates.io those crates belong to, like cat-science-badge . New Rust programmers should be comfortable reading from the first section to the last, and doing so should give one a strong overview of the crate ecosystem. Click on the section header in the index, or in the sidebar to navigate to the page for that section of the book. If you are simply looking for the solution to a simple task, the cookbook is today more difficult to navigate. The easiest way to find a specific recipe is to scan the index looking for the crates and categories one is interested in. From there, click on the name of the recipe to view it. This will improve in the future.","breadcrumbs":"How to read this book","id":"about.html#how-to-read-this-book","title":"How to read this book"},"about.html#how-to-use-the-recipes":{"body":"Recipes are designed to give you instant access to working code, along with a full explanation of what it is doing, and to guide you to further information. All recipes in the cookbook are full, self contained programs, so that they may be copied directly into your own projects for experimentation. To do so follow the instructions below. Consider this example for \"generate random numbers within a range\": rand-badge cat-science-badge extern crate rand;\nuse rand::Rng; fn main() { let mut rng = rand::thread_rng(); println!(\"Random f64: {}\", rng.gen::<f64>());\n} To work with it locally we can run the following commands to create a new cargo project, and change to that directory: cargo new my-example --bin\ncd my-example Now, we also need to add the necessary crates to Cargo.toml , as indicated by the crate badges, in this case just \"rand\". To do so, we'll use the cargo add command, which is provided by the cargo-edit crate, which we need to install first: cargo install cargo-edit\ncargo add rand Now you can replace src/main.rs with the full contents of the example and run it: cargo run The crate badges that accompany the examples link to the crates' full documentation on docs.rs , and is often the next documentation you should read after deciding which crate suites your purpose.","breadcrumbs":"How to use the recipes","id":"about.html#how-to-use-the-recipes","title":"How to use the recipes"},"about.html#table-of-contents":{"body":"Who this book is for How to read this book How to use the recipes A note about error handling A note about crate representation","breadcrumbs":"Table of contents","id":"about.html#table-of-contents","title":"Table of contents"},"about.html#who-this-book-is-for":{"body":"This cookbook is intended for new Rust programmers, so that they may quickly get an overview of the capabilities of the Rust crate ecosystem.

The l2 norm calculation is the simpler of the two, as it is the square root of the dot product of a vector with itself, shown in the function l2_norm . The l1 norm, shown in the function l1_norm , is computed by a fold operation that sums the absolute values of the elements. (This could also be performed with x.mapv(f64::abs).scalar_sum() , but that would allocate a new array for the result of the mapv .) Note that both l1_norm and l2_norm take the ArrayView1 type. This recipe considers vector norms, so the norm functions only need to accept one dimensional views (hence ArrayView1 ). While the functions could take a parameter of type &Array1<f64> instead, that would require the caller to have a reference to an owned array, which is more restrictive than just having access to a view (since a view can be created from any array or view, not just an owned array). The most convenient argument type for the caller would be &ArrayBase<S, Ix1> where S: Data , because then the caller could use &array or &view instead of x.view() .

Without & , the arrays are consumed. In the first example, arrays a and b are moved in the let-statement z = a + b . In the second example, the arrays c and d are not moved and instead, a new array is created for w . Updating either of c or d after the vector sum has no effect the value of w .

There may be no mean, median or mode to calculate for an empty set of data, so each function returns an [ Option ] to be handled by the caller. The first example calculates the mean (the sum of all measurements divided by the number of measurements in the set) by producing an iterator of references over the data, and using [ sum ] and [ len ] to determine the total value and count of values respectively. fn main() { let data = [3, 1, 6, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 10, 11]; let sum = data.iter().sum::<i32>() as f32; let count = data.len(); let mean = match count { positive if positive > 0 => Some(sum / count as f32), _ => None }; println!(\"Mean of the data is {:?}\", mean);\n} The second example calculates the median using the quickselect algorithm, which avoids a full [ sort ] by sorting only partitions of the data set known to possibly contain the median. This uses [ cmp ] and [ Ordering ] to succinctly decide the next partition to examine, and [ split_at ] to choose an arbitrary pivot for the next partition at each step. use std::cmp::Ordering; fn partition(data: &[i32]) -> Option<(Vec<i32>, i32, Vec<i32>)> { match data.len() { 0 => None, _ => { let (pivot_slice, tail) = data.split_at(1); let pivot = pivot_slice[0]; let (left, right) = tail.iter() .fold((vec![], vec![]), |mut splits, next| { { let (ref mut left, ref mut right) = &mut splits; if next < &pivot { left.push(*next); } else { right.push(*next); } } splits }); Some((left, pivot, right)) } }\n} fn select(data: &[i32], k: usize) -> Option<i32> { let part = partition(data); match part { None => None, Some((left, pivot, right)) => { let pivot_idx = left.len(); match pivot_idx.cmp(&k) { Ordering::Equal => Some(pivot), Ordering::Greater => select(&left, k), Ordering::Less => select(&right, k - (pivot_idx + 1)), } }, }\n} fn median(data: &[i32]) -> Option<f32> { let size = data.len(); match size { even if even % 2 == 0 => { let fst_med = select(data, (even / 2) - 1); let snd_med = select(data, even / 2); match (fst_med, snd_med) { (Some(fst), Some(snd)) => Some((fst + snd) as f32 / 2.0), _ => None } }, odd => select(data, odd / 2).map(|x| x as f32) }\n} fn main() { let data = [3, 1, 6, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 10, 11]; let part = partition(&data); println!(\"Partition is {:?}\", part); let sel = select(&data, 5); println!(\"Selection at ordered index {} is {:?}\", 5, sel); let med = median(&data); println!(\"Median is {:?}\", med);\n} The final example calculates the mode using a mutable [ HashMap ] to collect counts of each distinct integer from the set, using a [ fold ] and the [ entry ] API.
